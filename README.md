# Blog Project

This is a blog made with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It lets you read lots of posts, like and save your favorites, and join the conversation by commenting. If you sign up, you can also write your own posts and edit or delete the ones you’ve made. It’s built with modern tools to make everything run smoothly and look great.

The blog uses a backend API that I developed to handle data storage and retrieval. You can find the API here: [API Link](https://github.com/hugolomba/blog-api)

## Features

- React 19 for building user interfaces
- Vite for fast development and build
- Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI for styling
