# Blog Project

This is a blog made with React and Tailwind CSS. It lets you read posts, like and save your favorites, and join the conversation by commenting. If you sign up, you can also write your own posts and edit or delete the ones youâ€™ve made. 

The blog uses a backend API that I developed to handle data storage and retrieval. You can find the API here: [API Link](https://github.com/hugolomba/blog-api)

## Features

- React 19 for building user interfaces
- Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI for styling
- React Router for routing
- React Query for data fetching and state management
- TinyMCE and Quill for rich text editing
- Axios for HTTP requests
